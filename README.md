# Spotify-clone 


This project is a responsive clone of Spotify's online application built with HTML and CSS.Without using any pre-made CSS frameworks like Bootstrap,
it aims to replicate the design and structure of the Spotify web player. I'd like to present you with a gorgeous Spotify clone created with HTML and CSS.
The original platform's core is embraced by our clone's seamless design, which also offers a user-friendly interface and aesthetically beautiful 
appearance.
